Working in teams they were taught by professional developers to build simple command-line games and apps in Node.js, then fronted those games and apps in an HTML5 client.","Our Bootcampers also learned a great deal about themselves, gaining soft skills toward job readiness, and learned video screen casting with Andrew Larimer of FatHappy Media, studied the sweet stylings of CSS under Chris Boudy of Teens for Tech, and were addressed on life as a professional by guest speakers Brian Bordainick of Dinner Lab, Barrett Conrad of Cotingasoft, and Uchechi Kalu Jacobson and Peter Jacobson of Wedocracy.","As a participant in 4.0 Schools\' 2014 Summer Launch program, Operation Spark received both the Judges\' Prize and the Audience-Choice Award in New York on August 21st, 2014.","Operation Spark officially launched as a non-profit on August 5th, 2014.","Our objectives are aimed at providing access for all - literacy in software creation for all youth in Louisiana!

And each of these skills lead to careers, careers with futures - for example, an entry level quality assurance analyst is a well paying position, and can lead to management or a career as a UX designer.","Working in teams, inherently a part of software development, also introduces youth to effective means of communication and conflict resolution.","The Operation Spark model is simple: By introducing young adults to this wide set of skills and helping them apply these skills in building simple projects, something as engaging to today’s youth as a mobile video game or app, participants may just discover a very employable field about which they are passionate.
