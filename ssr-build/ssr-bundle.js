They will carry you through career changes and any type of social situation.","At Operation Spark, we’re going to push you to be your best. If you’re not willing to let us help you or if you are not willing to approach this fearlessly, then maybe Operation Spark isn’t for you. That’s completely okay and we understand. But at the same time, we know you can do it because we’ve seen others before you do it and do it well. We want you to have this amazing opportunity to improve your skills and improve yourself, but it must start from you. You have to work not against us, but join the team and work with us.","So what does this actually mean? To become great at software engineer, you must become self-reliant and a great problem solver. Keep in mind that everyone’s time is valuable and the answer is usually right at your fingertips. Before asking a question, you must ask yourself:","Many developers have come across the same problems you are trying to solve, and many other developers have helped solve those problems with well documented solutions. Don\'t panic when you get stuck! Do some research on Google and you will most likely find the solutions to your conundrum. It may be that someone has asked and someone has answered your exact same question. You will get the highest badge of honor, the INFORMATION SURVIVALIST BADGE, in recognition of your self reliance.","Most importantly, don\'t be afraid to share the answers to your own questions! This will increase our knowledge base and may help someone else on your team significantly. Remember, the better everyone on your team becomes, the better you will become."]},{"name":"Yours is not Better than Theirs","image":"better","desc":["Competition is sometimes a great thing and can really push people to become better at something really quickly. We want you to push each other to be better software developers and people, but we want you to do it in a constructive manner.","If you understand a concept, that’s great! But if you see that your teammate next to you is struggling, don’t brag about how you get it. Help them!! Kudos to you if you’re a fast learner, but you have to acknowledge that your team is only as strong as the weakest link.","Understand your strengths and weaknesses and lean on your teammates’ strengths when you need them. You will excel at certain parts of computer programming and you will struggle on others. Don’t push others down in an attempt to make yourself seem like “the best software programmer”. Again, software is built by great teams and it’s counterproductive to make someone else feel inadequate and less-than. By bragging about yourself, you are damaging other’s path towards learning, when you should be helping them surpass any emotional barrier that’s holding them back."]},{"name":"Listen First, Talk Second","image":"listen","desc":["One of the most important things you should acknowledge in your life is that you don’t know everything. Embrace “I know what I don’t know” and “I don’t know what I don’t know”. Listen to those around you who are knowledgeable and always think before speaking. This is an invaluable skill and is what separates the great programmers from the good ones.","It is most probable that in any situation that you haven’t thought of all the solutions. Given the nature of human beings, we have a limited perspective, and therefore can’t see all the sides of something at the same time. Just have a look at any object in front of you now: can you see the back of this object? Do you know if there’s a monkey on the other side of your computer screen or a lizard clinging to the back of your iPhone right now? No you don’t, but with the help of someone on the other side of the object, you can.","The best programmers we’ve ever worked with have also been the most humble, most generous, and most giving people. They are hungry for knowledge, so they never miss an opportunity to listen and learn. Try to be that person."]},{"name":"Be a Mentor and Be Mentored","image":"mentor","desc":["Throughout your Operation Spark experience, there are going to be a variety of professionals that come and spend time with you. They are going to have years of experience and will seem ever so wise. This is your chance! If you really jive with someone, don’t hesitate to ask them to be your mentor. The best way to accelerate your development is to learn from people who have done it before. They will save you several hours of time with just a couple minutes of advice - you just have to ask!","To create a great relationship with your mentor, it is also important to be a great mentee. These professionals are dedicating their time and effort to help you, so you must be appreciative and grateful for their help. Be accountable and follow through with your mentor, so they continue to invest in you and help guide you through your journey to becoming a super awesome software developer.","We also want you to remember that we are not a school. You chose to apply to Operation Spark and we chose to accept you based on your desire to learn, your willingness to change, and your ability to play nice with others. But very soon, we want you to start thinking of us as your colleagues. We are not your school teachers or principals, and we are definitely not your bosses. The only rules you must respect are outlined in this document. On that note, it is okay to also mentor your mentors. Be open and honest and provide feedback when solicited. This is a great way for you to be a great mentee and help your mentor get better as well."]}]')},Y3FI:function(e,t,a){"use strict";a.r(t),a.d(t,"subscribers",(function(){return
